With this project I try to play the role of a reviewer.I review my old code from Trials and try to detect
any bad coding style,solutions and conventions, extended use of div's or not using any semantic tags.
With the new things I've learned I should find alot of these and try to use the correct tags and
conventions in the future projects.
